        <h2>Technical Parameters</h2>
        <div>
            There is no formal requirement to use any particular technique, and you may use any of the HTML and CSS tools that we have addressed so far (e.g. HTML links; pictures/images; CSS rules such as <em>position: fixed</em>, <em>font-family</em>, margins and padding, and so forth).  
        </div>

        <h2>Design Parameters</h2>
        <div>
            The site that you build must be orchestrated with your content.  In other words, the style of the site — its color, tone, rhythm, typography, responsiveness, layout, and so forth — must <em>react</em> (think of a chemical reaction) with the concept of your site.  While that reaction must be orchestrated, it can be of any type (the design can add to the concept, undermine it, contrast with it, compound with it...).
