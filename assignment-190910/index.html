            Prerequisites

        <p>
            <a href="../dev-environment">You should have VS Code installed (with Git for Windows, or Git BASH)</a>, and you should use that to write assignments and push them to your Github page.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Have a local ("on your computer") copy of the assignment due September 3rd to work with.

            Add a CSS stylesheet to design (or redesign) your first assignment.  You should consider background and text color using hex (or hexidecimal) notation (e.g. "#0f0").  You should consider how you are laying out the page with margins and padding.  You should consider the font that you are using for different parts of the page.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, if you have an idea for how your page should look that we didn't cover, do some research.  You can find a list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">all CSS properties at MDN</a>, as well as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">a series of CSS guides</a>.

        <p>
            Designing for the web is all about CSS.  CSS determines nearly everything about how a web page looks: how big or small parts of the page are, their color, whether they move or animate, how the browser organizes the page, and even whether elements show up at all.  In this assignment we introduce some of the things CSS can do.
